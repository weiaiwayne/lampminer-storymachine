**Host:** Hello, hello, hello, Super Friends! It's your pal, Penelope the Parrot, here with the latest news, especially squawked just for you! Are you ready to put on your thinking caps? Let’s dive in!

**(Transition Music: A short, playful jingle)**

**Host:** Our first story is about... money! You know how when you earn your allowance, you can choose to spend it at different places? Well, some people have a neat idea. It’s like a special game where if you spend your money at certain stores, that money goes back to *you* somehow! It's like a boomerang, but with dollars! These stores make sure to re-use the money at the same places where people paid. It’s a way of helping everyone in your community. Think of it as sharing your toys in a way that makes sure everyone gets a turn, and the toys stay in good condition! Isn’t that clever? Now, that's a really nice way to share and make sure everyone has what they need!

**Host:** Next up, let's travel all the way to a place called Pakistan and India! These two countries are neighbors, like if you lived next door to your best friend. Now, sometimes neighbors don't always agree, right? Well, lately they've been having some big disagreements. It's like a squabble over who gets to use the swingset first.

It seems like there was some accidental shooting, and Pakistan and India have been accusing each other. Now, grown-ups all over the world – from countries like the United States and even the countries in something called the G7 – are saying, "Hey, let’s all take a deep breath and *talk* it out." Remember what we learned about using our words to solve problems? It’s super important for countries to do that, too. Because, like you know, we all share the same world! Let’s all clap our hands for peace and working together! (Claps). It’s always better to be friends than to fight, and you can even be friends if you disagree, because everyone is different, and it's important to respect that.

**Host:** Now, let's fly across the ocean to Europe. Some big grown-ups there are thinking about something super serious. It involves making sure everyone is treated fairly, even if they are presidents or important people! It's like if someone at school didn't follow the rules, and everyone wants to make sure they get a fair chance to explain themselves. They're discussing whether to have a special kind of court – it’s called a tribunal – to make sure things are fair and just. It's a way of protecting the rules and making sure everyone, big or small, follows them!

**Host:** Speaking of grown-ups, some young people are trying to get jobs as writers, to help business. It's like when you make a sign for your lemonade stand to get people to buy your lemonade, but this is to get people to buy products and visit stores. They're offering free copies, which means free products, just so you know that they are very good at getting other people to spend money. Remember, even though they're young, they are very smart. That means that young people are still useful, no matter how old they are!

**Host:** Our last story is about... deserts! In California, there’s a new Chuckwalla National Monument. Monuments are like special parks dedicated to beautiful nature.

Some people are happy about it, others are not. They are having a discussion. And that's ok. You don't always need to agree, but you can always listen.
**(Transition Music)**

**Host:** Wow! That was a lot of news for one day! Remember, even though grown-up stuff can sound complicated, it’s all about people, sharing, being fair, and working together, just like what we do at school! Penelope the Parrot signing off, wishing you all a super-duper day filled with kindness and smiles!
