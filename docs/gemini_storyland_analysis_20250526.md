**Host (Energetic and friendly):** Hello, first graders! Welcome to "News for Nippers," where we make grown-up news super fun and easy to understand! I'm your host, and I'm so excited to tell you what's been happening in the world today!

**(Transition music - a short, playful jingle)**

**Host:** First up, remember when we talked about movies and how sometimes accidents can happen on set? Well, someone who worked on a movie called “Rust” is coming home after a little time away. It’s a reminder that being careful and responsible is super important, no matter what job you have, even if it’s making movies! Like being careful when you are painting with paint or when you are playing with scissors in art class.

**Host:** Now, let's zoom over to France! The President of France, that’s like the head honcho of their country, is going on a big trip to Asia. It's like when you trade stickers with your friends, but instead of stickers, they're trading ideas about things like sharing energy and cool tech stuff. That way everyone can get along and share their toys.

**(Transition music)**

**Host:** Oh dear. The grown-ups are talking about some leaders not getting along again, like on the playground, but on a much bigger scale. There are these two leaders named Trump and Putin. It sounds like they are not being very kind to each other. Remember what our teachers say, “Use kind words and have kind thoughts!” It applies to everyone, even people who lead countries!

**(Transition music)**

**Host:** Sadly, speaking of not getting along, there's some trouble in the ocean. A big ship carrying all sorts of things like toys or art supplies has sunk near India. And it had hazardous cargo, which is a fancy name for stuff that can be yucky and needs to be cleaned up, like when you spill your juice and have to mop it up really quickly. Hopefully, everyone is safe, and they can clean up the mess. It’s a reminder to be mindful of our planet and how we treat it.

**(Transition music)**

**Host:** Now, let's talk about something called Social Security and Medicare. That’s a mouthful! These are like piggy banks that help people when they get older. But here’s the thing: a long time ago, there were lots and lots of people putting coins into the piggy bank for every one person taking coins out. But now, there are fewer people putting coins in and more people taking them out! So, the government is taking more money from those who are working to fill that gap. Hmm… It’s like if your older siblings kept borrowing all your allowance – not so fair, is it? The grown-ups are trying to figure out how to make sure everyone gets their share, even way into the future. It is also a reminder for kids to save their allowances and not rely on their parents all the time.

**(Transition music)**

**Host:** Next up! Someone who is really good at helping businesses with computers, like designing websites or making cool apps, needs help from an economist to sign a paper. It’s like when you need a grown-up to sign a permission slip for a field trip. This economist will look at the computer work and say if it is good for businesses. It is good to seek help from others when you need it.

**(Transition music)**

**Host:** Remember those rules about charging money for things, like when you're selling lemonade? Well, Trump (we talked about him earlier) wants to charge extra money for things that come from Europe! It’s called a tariff. But now he is delaying it. It's like saying "I'm going to charge you extra for that cookie… but nevermind, I will wait a little bit".

**(Transition music)**

**Host:** Remember that saying, “Two wrongs don’t make a right?” Well, sometimes people will get upset about small things that people do, like wearing certain clothes, when people should be focusing on the important things.

**(Transition music)**

**Host:** Next up! Imagine your doctor wasn't giving you enough band-aids when you needed them. Well, that’s kind of what this company called BlackRock thinks is happening. They're saying that UnitedHealth is giving too much care to patients and they don’t like it. This is a complicated one. It’s like arguing over how many cookies everyone gets.

**(Transition music)**

**Host:** Remember those digital tokens we talked about? Cryptocurrencies? There is a worry they might cause problems. It is like when a tower of blocks is built too high, and it comes crashing down. Hopefully, the grown-ups can figure things out and keep everything safe.

**(Transition music)**

**Host:** Imagine you borrowed money to buy something really cool, like a scooter, but then you couldn't pay it back! That’s what’s happening to some grown-ups with their student loans. And it's making their "credit score" go down. A credit score is like a report card for how well you pay your bills! So, always try to pay your debts on time.

**(Transition music)**

**Host:** Uh oh, here’s one that might affect some of your parents. It sounds like it’s harder to find a job right now. It is like a really long line for ice cream, and there is not enough ice cream to go around for everyone. If your parents are looking for jobs, be extra helpful around the house!

**(Transition music)**

**Host:** Here are some cool stories! Someone had an idea and they turned it into something really special! They are helping others by creating something and making a business.

**(Transition music)**

**Host:** Do your parents use Meta, like Facebook or Instagram? Well, someone is offering to help them set up ads! Remember what our parents tell us? Be careful before you click on random ads.

**(Transition music)**

**Host:** Here is someone who has one business and wants to start other businesses. And they are going to get funding from the main business.

**(Transition music)**

**Host:** Check this out! You can visit styli.ca and use code ‘STYLI20’ for 20% off all orders!

**(Transition music)**

**Host:** And here's another cool story! Someone made a free profit tracking tool for ecommerce owners. It helps people track their profits on shopify. It is nice when people share their talents with others!

**(Transition music)**

**Host:** And that's all the news for today, first graders! Remember, even though some of this stuff sounds complicated, the important thing is to be kind, helpful, and to always keep learning!
