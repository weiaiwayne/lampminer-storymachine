Okay, here we go! Lights, camera, bananas!

Hello, Super Friends! It's your pal, Penelope the Parrot, reporting live from… well, my perch! Today is bursting with news, like a piñata filled with…puzzles! Let’s crack them open, shall we?

First up, we have a big news item about a man named Warren Buffett. Now, Warren isn’t your average guy who likes to eat burgers (though I bet he does!). He’s like the super-smart captain of a giant treasure ship filled with money, also known as a business! And guess what? He's decided he's going to retire at the end of the year, like he wants to take a really, really long nap after a lifetime of working hard. That means someone else will get to steer that treasure ship! It makes you wonder, doesn't it? What kind of captain will they be? What treasures will they discover? Remember, even the best captains need to rest, and sometimes, it's good to let someone else have a turn to lead!

Next, let's talk about cars! Zoom, zoom! You know how your parents need gas to make the car go? Well, sometimes the price of things goes up and down depending on where they come from, and that's what's happening with car parts! Our grown-ups call these extra payments when things cross from one country to another "tariffs". Imagine if you had to pay extra to get your favorite crayons from the store – that's kind of what this is like. It may mean the cars we have in the future change because the people who make the cars might need to get the parts from different places.

Speaking of making things, I have a story that's like a little cloud with a silver lining. A really important person in the world of grown-up worky-jobs, Mr. Howard Lutnick, said something interesting: that it's time to help people learn new jobs. Sometimes, the jobs people used to do aren't needed anymore because things change, kind of like how we don't use horse-drawn carriages to go to school, right? He thinks we should train people to do the awesome future jobs. It’s really important that we care about our neighbors and want them to be happy and healthy, and work is a part of that!

Now, this next one is a bit serious, but it’s important to know about. Sometimes, grown-ups disagree about things and want to show they disagree by gathering together. It’s like when you and your friend disagree about which game to play, but instead of choosing a game, they may pitch tents and say what they think is right or wrong! That's what happened at a college called Swarthmore, where grown-up students had a disagreement and the police had to ask them to leave. Remember, it's important to be kind and respectful, even when we don't agree.

Speaking of being kind, let’s talk about helping others! Someone wants to start a business helping people in their church and elderly people fix their cars for a lower price! Isn't that a great idea? It's like being a super-mechanic and a super-friend all in one! He can use his gifts and skills to give back to others, which is pretty awesome. Helping others with what we have is how we help the world to be a better place.

Now, for something a little strange. It seems some sneaky people tried to peek at secret files at a place called the National Labor Relations Board – that's a mouthful! It's like trying to peek at someone else's puzzle before they're finished. That's not fair, is it? It’s important to respect privacy and trust others!

And finally, a sad story. A young woman in Canada passed away from a sickness. It’s a reminder that we need to take care of ourselves and each other. If you feel sick, tell a grown-up! And always remember to be kind to those around you, because you never know what they might be going through.

**(Penelope takes a dramatic breath)**

Phew! That was a lot of news! Remember, Super Friends, the world is a big and sometimes confusing place, but it’s also full of amazing people doing amazing things. And even though things change and sometimes bad things happen, it is important to show love, kindness, and forgiveness. Never stop asking questions, and always try to be a light in the world!

**(Upbeat, friendly music outro begins)**

That’s all for today’s newscast! Penelope the Parrot, signing off… with a squawk and a smile! Stay curious, stay kind, and keep those feathers flying!
