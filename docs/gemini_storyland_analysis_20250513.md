Okay, boys and girls, gather 'round! Auntie Gabby's got the news, kid-style! Ready? *DING DING DING!* (That's my imaginary news bell!)

First up: Remember how sometimes families need a safe place to live? Well, the United States is like a big, friendly house. And guess what? They're opening the door to some people from South Africa who need a little help. It's like inviting a friend over for a playdate when they're having a tough time at their own house! Isn't it nice to be kind and share what we have?

Oh no! Speaking of not-so-fun things, some brave climbers in Washington State – they were trying to climb a mountain, which is super cool, but something went wrong with their ropes. It's really sad, because three of them are now with Jesus. Let's all be extra careful when we’re playing, and remember those who have gone to be with God.

Now, let’s talk about grown-up squabbles! Imagine two kids, India and the United States, are trading snacks. But the US says, "Hey, you have to pay extra for my steel!" (Steel is like super-strong building blocks). India says, "No fair! I'll charge YOU extra for some of MY snacks!" They're having a little disagreement, but hopefully, they can share fairly soon! It's always better to be good sharers, right?

Next, we have a serious topic. There was a plane that was shot down over a country called Russia a while ago. The United Nations, which is like the world's referee, figured out that Russia was responsible. It's very sad and something we should pray won't happen again.

Uh oh, trouble down south! Mexico is like our neighbor, and they raise cows. The US isn’t buying their beef right now because of a pesky bug called a screwworm! Imagine a tiny, annoying mosquito that only hurts cows. It means no yummy tacos for a while! (Okay, maybe that’s an exaggeration, but you get the idea!). Hopefully, they can get rid of those bugs soon!

Now, for a story about bravery! There was a man named Edan who was captured by some not-so-nice people, and he was being held hostage for a long time. Some people worked really hard to get him back home safely. It's so important to be brave and never give up, just like in our favorite superhero stories!

Speaking of Grown-ups not agreeing on things: There’s a lot of stuff going on about the US trading with China. Some people are putting *extra* charges, called tariffs, on things from other countries. It's like adding a dollar to the price of your favorite toy – not fun, right? Grown-ups are trying to figure out how to make trading fair for everyone. It reminds us that sharing is important.

Phew! That was a lot of serious news. But guess what else happened? Scientists are working on a new eye drug that might help people see better! Isn't science amazing? It’s like a real-life magic potion to help people, and God gave us the minds to do it.

Now, let's jump over to the Philippines! Someone named Rodrigo Duterte won an election, even though he was in jail! That sounds like something out of a crazy movie! Politics can be very complicated, but remember, it's important to be fair and just, even when things are tricky.

And in Australia, a lady named Sussan Ley became the leader of a big political group! Go, girls! It’s wonderful when everyone gets a chance to lead and share their ideas.

Finally, remember how important water is? Well, India and Pakistan are having a disagreement about water! It's getting hotter because of something called climate change, and water is getting scarcer. Let’s remember to be thankful for clean water and try our best to save it! Don’t waste it!

And that's the news for today, folks! Remember to be kind, be brave, and always try to share! Auntie Gabby's out! *DING!*
