(Upbeat, friendly music intro)

**Host:** Hello, explorers! It’s your pal, Alex, here with today’s news – made just for YOU! Are you ready to zoom around the world with me? Let’s go!

**(Transition to a map of the world)**

**Host:** Our first stop is… Africa! Specifically, a country called Congo. Imagine a HUGE rainstorm, like, super-duper HUGE! Well, it rained so much there that it caused a flood, and sadly, over one hundred people are in trouble. It reminds us how important it is to be kind and help others when they’re having a tough time, doesn't it? And we can pray for them.

**Host:** Next, let's hop over to Milwaukee, a city in the United States. Sadly, there was a big fire in an apartment building. That means lots of people had to leave their homes. Firefighters are heroes who help put out fires and keep people safe. It's a good reminder to always be careful with things that can burn, and to have a grown-up check your smoke detectors to make sure they’re working.

**(Transition to a picture of a leveled house)**

**Host:** Now, BOOM! That’s not a good BOOM, but a house in New Jersey had a big explosion. We don't know exactly why it happened, but it's a reminder that sometimes, things break unexpectedly, and we need to be ready to help out.

**(Transition to a picture of a boat)**

**Host:** Ahoy, Mateys! Next, we're sailing to the Galapagos Islands! Can you imagine being lost at sea for 55 whole days? Five fishermen were! They survived by collecting rainwater and… well, let's just say they had fishy dinners! They worked together and never gave up, which shows how important it is to have courage and help each other, even when things get really, really hard. They show us the importance of persevering and relying on each other.

**(Transition to a picture of world leaders)**

**Host:** Okay, now for some grown-up talk. There are important people called leaders in different countries like Ukraine and Russia, and they are trying to figure out how to stop fighting and have peace. It’s like when you and your friend have a disagreement; talking it out is always better than yelling! The Pope, who is like a super-important leader for many Christians, wants them to find peace too. It’s a reminder that everyone, everywhere, wants to be friends and live in harmony.

**(Transition to a picture of dry cracked land)**

**Host:** Uh oh, our earth needs our care! In some parts of Australia, it hasn’t rained enough and things are drying up. This is called a drought. Farmers need rain to grow food, and when it’s dry, it makes it hard. It reminds us that we need to be good stewards of the earth, saving water whenever we can and taking care of our planet.

**(Transition to a picture of pills or medication)**

**Host:** Did you know that medicine helps people feel better when they're sick? Sometimes medicine can be really expensive, but some people are working hard to make sure everyone can get the medicine they need at prices they can afford.

**(Transition to a picture of a person working on a computer)**

**Host:** Now, some older kids are trying to decide what they want to be when they grow up. Some are thinking about starting their own businesses, like a lemonade stand, but for grown-ups! It’s important to work hard and use your talents, whatever you decide to do. And even if you make mistakes, keep trying and learning.

**(Transition to a globe)**

**Host:** Wow, we traveled all over the world today! We saw people helping each other, trying to make peace, taking care of the Earth, and working hard. And while grown-ups are figuring out the grown-up stuff, remember that being kind, helpful, and brave makes a BIG difference, no matter how small you are.

**(Transition back to the host)**

**Host:** That's all the news for today, explorers! Keep being curious, keep being kind, and keep exploring! See you next time!
