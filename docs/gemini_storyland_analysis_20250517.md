Hello everybody! It's me, your pal, the News Narrator, here to tell you what's been happening in the big, wide world today! Ready? Let’s jump in!

First up, some very sad news from a long time ago. Imagine someone taking something that doesn't belong to them and hurting someone in the process. That’s what happened way back in 1997 when someone robbed a bank. Well, after a very long time, the person who did it has said he’s sorry for the hurt he caused. It reminds us that even if it takes a while, doing the right thing and telling the truth is always important.

Now, for another sad story. Some places had really, really bad weather. Like, super strong wind weather! We’re talking about a tornado. And some people got hurt. When a storm is bad, it’s super important to listen to grown-ups and find a safe place to be. Remember the story of Noah and the Ark? Even though the storm seemed like it would last forever, being safe and trusting God's guidance got them through. It's kind of like that.

Next, let’s talk about a grown-up problem. Sometimes countries don't agree. It’s like when you and your friend argue over a toy. Right? Well, some countries in Europe are putting extra charges, called tariffs, on things they buy from Russia and Belarus, especially food and fertilizer. Fertilizer is what farmers put on their plants to help them grow big and strong, just like you need good food to grow! So this might make those things cost a little more. Hopefully, they can find a way to be friends again and share nicely.

Okay, pop quiz! What's a census? It's like when you count everyone in your class to see how many kids are there. Well, India is going to do that, but they are also going to ask people what kind of family they come from. It's important to remember that no matter what kind of family anyone comes from, we are all special and important and loved by God.

Now for a not so serious one... Imagine a test, but all the questions were blank! Can you even imagine that?! Well, some students in Nigeria had some trouble with their tests, and even had power cuts during the exam! It reminds us that even when things are hard, we can still try our best and be brave. Remember the story of David and Goliath? He didn't have the best weapon but he was brave and trusted in God.

Here's a confusing one: Some people were protesting and causing trouble, and some police asked another person to help them. But that person wasn't the best helper and now people are not so happy. It’s important to always choose good friends who make good choices, right?

Now, let’s talk about votes! In Venezuela, some people want everyone to NOT vote in the next election. That’s like saying, “Don’t choose what you want for lunch!” But other people think voting is important to help choose good leaders. It's like when everyone in class gets to vote on what game to play at recess!

Now, let’s talk about money! It's kind of like when you have a piggy bank with coins. There's something called “credit rating” which is like a report card for how good a country is at paying its bills. A company called Moody's said that the United States isn't doing as great as they used to and lowered the country’s score. This means it might be a little harder for the US to borrow money. It's a reminder that we should all try to be responsible with our things and be wise with our money.

Also, it sounds like things we buy might still cost a little more, even if some people tried to make them cheaper. It reminds us to be thankful for what we have, even if it’s not everything we want.

And here's a fun one! Someone wants to start a cruise ship business! Like a giant floating hotel that sails on the ocean! It's a big dream, and it costs a LOT of money. Starting a business can be hard work. It’s important to plan and be smart, like when you’re building a tower of blocks. Gotta make sure it's sturdy!

Finally, some grown-ups are talking about whether churches should pay taxes. Taxes are like when you give a little bit of your allowance to help pay for things like roads and schools. Some people think churches should pay taxes too, while others disagree. It's important to remember that giving and sharing is important. Remember the story of the Good Samaritan? He helped someone in need, even though it cost him something.

(Upbeat, playful music fades back in)

And that’s all the news for today, folks! Remember to be kind, helpful, and always try your best. And don’t forget to ask questions! The world is a big, interesting place, and there’s always something new to learn. Bye for now!
