Hey everybody, it's me, Sparky the Newscaster, here to tell you what's been happening in the world today!

First, some good news! Grown-ups in charge – they're called Congress – made a new rule to help keep people safe online. Imagine someone taking a picture of you and sharing it without asking, or even making a fake picture that isn't true. It's not very nice, right? This new rule says that's not allowed! It's all about being kind and respectful, even when we're using computers and phones. It helps us remember to treat others the way we want to be treated. Remember what we learned in Sunday school about loving our neighbors? That applies online too!

Now, sometimes sad things happen too. I heard about a very smart man who invented a fun toy called LeapFrog, but he got very sick with a disease that made him forget things. He decided to go to Heaven early with the help of doctors. It's sad when people we love leave us, but remember, they’re always in our hearts and we can remember all the good things they did. It reminds us that life is a precious gift and to make the most of every day!

Speaking of sad things, I also heard about some accidents. A car crashed into a place where kids were playing after school, and some people got hurt. And in another place, someone drove their car into people, and many people died. These things are very sad and show us that we need to be careful. It also makes us think about how important it is to be kind and help others.

But there are nice people in the world. Someone said something about people leaving bad reviews for a business that was scammed. It reminds us that there are bad actors in the world that try to tarnish good work. It is important to remember the real work, and not get affected by such behaviors.

Alright, let's move to election. It is like a game where adults choose who will be the boss to lead their country. I heard in a place called Canada, the boss they have now will stay, but he has to share his toys and work with other people, called a minority government. I hope the different political parties work together in Canada.

Then there's another part of the world called Gaza, where people haven’t been getting along. It sounds like they are trying to agree on a ceasefire, which would mean no more fighting! I wonder if you should offer them your kindness and toy to solve their problems?

Did you know where your apples come from? I heard that soon, the apples that grow in Australia will be sold to kids in China! That’s because grown-ups are learning to share and trade things across the world. Imagine sharing your toys with someone far away – that's kind of what's happening with apples.

Oh, and a grown-up in Israel called Shin Bet is going to retire from his job. It sounds like he was the head of the guards, like the principal of a school, so that place is safe.

Now, things are getting a little bit trickier. I heard about the economy. That’s kind of like the world’s piggy bank. I heard some grown-ups are worried because lots of people lost their jobs, about 250,000!. And flights are taking longer time because the pilots are trying to fly safely. Grown-ups are sometimes worried about money, just like you might be worried about having enough allowance for a special toy. But remember, money isn’t everything. Things that are really important are having good friends, a loving family, and taking care of each other.

Some grown-ups are arguing about things called tariffs. Imagine your mom and dad getting mad and punishing you for your wrongdoings, this is how governments punish each other. This leads to another round of tariffs! Tariffs are basically fees you pay to import and export! All this is affecting things like apples and soybeans, and even Christmas toys might be hard to find. Wow! I think someone needs to learn to share.

I even heard that some other countries might not want to use American dollars anymore and that the US economy is on a decline. That’s a little bit scary, but it also reminds us that things change, and we need to be prepared for anything. It's like when you are playing Lego, you need to have alternative designs!

The grown-ups mentioned something called CAC, and LTV and it's ratios, I have no clue what that is, but it sounds very important! Maybe we can get our parents to explain to us!

Remember, even though things in the world can sometimes seem confusing or even a little scary, it’s important to remember that God is always with us, and that we can always find ways to be kind, helpful, and brave.

That’s all the news for today! Keep shining your light, and I’ll see you next time! Bye!
