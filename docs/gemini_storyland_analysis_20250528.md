Hello, everyone! Gather ‘round, it’s time for “News for Little Sprouts”! I’m your host, Barnaby Bumble, and I've been buzzing around collecting the biggest news stories just for you. Hold on to your hats, it's going to be a busy day!

First up, some sad news from far, far away in China. Imagine a big factory where they make… oh, let's say bouncy balls! Well, there was a big *kaboom* at a factory like that, a chemical plant, and sadly, some people got hurt. It reminds us how important it is for grown-ups to be super careful when making things, and to follow the rules, just like when we're playing with our toys. It's important to pray and hope that the people get better quickly, and that everyone remembers to be safe.

Now, zooming over to New York City! Imagine a new friend comes to your school from another country. Sometimes, it can be tricky for them to understand everything, right? Well, there's a student in New York who came to America for a safe home, an immigrant student, and some grown-ups are cheering them on, making sure they feel welcome. It's always good to be kind and helpful to new friends! Being friendly is always the best policy.

Next, a splashy story from Grapevine Lake! You know how much fun jet skis are? Well, someone wasn’t being very careful on one, and they bumped into someone else and zoomed away! It's called a hit-and-run. But guess what? The police caught them! That teaches us that when we make a mistake, it’s important to say sorry and make things right. Owning up to our mistakes is always important.

Uh oh. Back to New York City. Remember that immigrant student? Now it turns out that some officers, from a group called ICE, stopped a public school student at their asylum hearing. This reminds us of the time Joseph was sold into slavery in Egypt. We have to always treat others with respect and kindness, the way we want to be treated.

Now, let's hop over to Turkey. The leader there, Mr. Erdogan, wants to make a new set of rules for the country – a new constitution. He has even appointed a team of lawyers. Some people are worried that he might want to stay in charge for a very, very long time. It makes you think about how important it is to have fair leaders who listen to everyone, and who give others a chance to lead too.

Ready for a twist? Even though some countries in Europe, the EU, are helping Ukraine, they ALSO bought lots of energy, like gas and oil, from Russia last year. Hmmm, that’s a bit like saying you're helping a friend build a fort, but secretly buying all your snacks from their rival. It reminds us to think carefully about where things come from, and whether our choices are helping the right people.

Speaking of helping people, farmers in South Korea are having a tough time. They can't find enough workers to help them grow food because of some new rules about who can work there. It shows us how important it is for everyone to have a chance to work hard and provide for their families, and for grown-ups to think carefully about how their decisions affect everyone.

Another challenge, this time in Brazil. A company that makes electric cars, called BYD, is being told it did bad things. It is accused of treating its workers unfairly, almost like slaves. It shows that no matter how exciting or new something is, like electric cars, it’s always important to treat everyone with kindness and fairness. It's a helpful reminder of the story of Exodus.

Oh dear. Over in Gaza, some people were so hungry they stole some food. Then the Hamas group, who are in charge there, punished them very harshly. It’s a reminder that when people are desperate, they might do things they wouldn’t normally do. It's important to share what we have and help those in need, just like Jesus taught.

Now for something a little different. A grown-up in London is thinking about letting people have a little bit of cannabis, which is a plant some people use like medicine, without getting in trouble. It’s making people think about what’s fair and what’s safe, and whether the rules we have make sense. It’s always good to ask “why?” about things!

More news from Gaza. People were trying to get food to those who needed it. But so many people needed help, they rushed the place where the food was being given out! It got too chaotic. It shows us how much people need help, and how tricky it can be to share things fairly.

Back in America, a place that makes yummy treats called Hostess – you know, like Twinkies – is closing down one of its factories in Indianapolis. That means some people will need to find new jobs. It reminds us that things change, and it’s important to be ready to learn new things and help each other out.

Finally, a little bit of learning news. Some grown-ups are wondering how to learn about running a business. They want to know if there are special classes or courses they can take to understand all the important things. It shows us that learning never stops, even when you’re all grown up!

And that's all the news for today, little sprouts! Remember to be kind, be curious, and always ask questions! Barnaby Bumble, signing off!
