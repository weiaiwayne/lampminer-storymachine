Alright, gather 'round, everybody! It's time for "The Big World News for Little Explorers"! I'm your pal, Newsy Nelly, ready to tell you what's been happening all over the planet today!

*Ding Ding Ding!*

First up, some news from way up north in a big city called New York! Imagine a super tall, strong bridge, strong enough to hold lots and lots of cars. It's called the Brooklyn Bridge! Well, guess what? A big, important boat from Mexico, like a floating school for sailors, accidentally bumped into it! It wasn't a big crash, more like a little "Oops! Excuse me!" The boat is okay, the bridge is okay, everyone's okay! It just shows that even grown-ups can make mistakes sometimes. The important thing is nobody was hurt! It reminds me of when we bump into each other in the hallway – we say sorry and keep on going, right?

Next, let's hop over to South America! Now, you know how much we love chicken nuggets and yummy chicken dinners, right? Well, sometimes, very tiny little germs can make chickens sick. It's like when you get a cold! So, some countries like Mexico, Chile, and Uruguay are being extra careful. They're taking a break from buying chickens from Brazil for a little while, just to make sure all the chickens are healthy and happy! It’s like when we wash our hands extra good to stop the spread of the germs. It's important to protect animals as well. It shows kindness and care for God's creations.

Now, this next story is a bit more grown-up, but it's important to know that sometimes people don't get along. There’s a country called Ukraine, and another country called Russia. For quite some time now, they have been experiencing conflict. Ukraine’s commander-in-chief has said that over 1,000 Russian tanks have been destroyed.

Another conflict in another part of the world is happening between Israel and Hamas. Hamas has proposed releasing some hostages in talks. It's like a disagreement that's gone on for too long, and it's making people sad. It's a reminder that it's always better to find ways to share and be friends. That's what Jesus wanted us to do!

And guess what? Some sneaky people were trying to trick a very smart man named Elon Musk. This former FBI agent is saying they used mean tricks to try and get him to do things he shouldn't. It reminds us that we should always be careful of strangers and stick with people we trust. Sometimes, people might try to trick you into doing things that aren’t nice. We need to be smart and tell a grown-up if someone is making us uncomfortable.

Okay, now for something a little different! Have you ever wanted to start your own business, like selling your amazing drawings or helping your neighbors with their pets? Well, someone learned how to sell things online using social media. They went to a free class that taught them cool tricks! They discovered how to find people who already want to buy what they're selling and how to write posts that make people interested! It’s so cool when you use your talents to help others and earn a little extra money! It shows that we can all learn new things and use them to make the world a better place.

And speaking of selling things, someone else needs help with their marble furniture. They have tables and clocks they are trying to sell. Maybe a school or community center can find a new use for the furniture.

And finally, a person who builds websites for other people has some advice! He says it's important to trust the people you work with, even if they don't know everything about computers. He said people who hire them also needs to collaborate and meet deadlines.

That’s it for today’s news, little explorers! Remember, even though grown-up news can sometimes sound confusing, it's all about people and their stories. And the most important story of all is that we should always try to be kind, helpful, and loving to everyone! Until next time, keep exploring and asking questions!
