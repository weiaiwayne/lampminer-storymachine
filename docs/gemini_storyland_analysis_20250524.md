Hello everyone, and welcome to Kid News! I'm your host, Sparky! Let's jump into what's been happening around the world.

First up, remember those robbers who took some things from Kim Kardashian in Paris? Well, they were found guilty, but guess what? They aren't going to go to jail! It's a bit like if you took a cookie from the cookie jar, and you knew you were wrong, but you didn't have to say sorry. Sometimes, grown-up decisions are a little confusing, aren’t they? We have to try to be fair, just like how Jesus taught us.

Now, imagine a giant balloon, bigger than your house, floating in the sky! That's a hot air balloon! But, uh oh, one of those balloons had a bit of a bumpy landing in Mexico, and some people got a little ouchie. Twelve people needed band-aids. It reminds us that even fun things need to be done super carefully.

Brrr! Let's talk about the Arctic! It's super cold up there, and some of the biggest countries in the world are all trying to get a piece of it. It's like when everyone wants the biggest slice of pizza at a party. It makes me think about sharing, and how everyone deserves a chance to have enough. We should always try to be peacemakers, right?

Speaking of sharing, remember how we were all wearing masks for a while? Well, there’s a new version of the sickness that’s been making people feel icky, and it's popping up in the news again. Being kind to our bodies and others and taking care when we are sick is important.

Okay, this is a cute one! A baby bear, all alone, was found in the woods! Aww! But don't worry, some super kind grown-ups are taking care of him. And get this – they're wearing bear costumes so the baby bear feels safe! How clever is that? It reminds me that everyone, even little baby bears, needs someone to care for them.

Next, way, way down in South Africa, they’re starting a big new company about oil! It’s like building a giant Lego castle to make sure everyone has enough energy. It also makes me think about other ways to power our cars and houses, things like the sun and wind. Using these resources is like taking care of God’s amazing creation.

Uh oh, now for some sad news. In a city far away called Kyiv, there have been loud booms and danger in the sky from missiles. People are in danger. It's really important to pray for those who are living in scary places, that they can be safe. And we should try our best to make the world a more peaceful place for everyone.

Imagine someone isn't playing fair. Well, that's happening in a country called Guatemala. Someone who is supposed to be a helper is using their power to go after other people. It reminds us that everyone deserves to be treated fairly. It is wrong to abuse power.

Sadly, some people called Rohingya are trying to find a safer place to live, but the trips they are taking are very dangerous. It's like trying to cross a river on a wobbly log. We should hope that these people can find a safe and happy place to live.

And speaking of being treated fairly, a judge said it wasn't fair to stop students from other countries from coming to a big school called Harvard. It's like saying everyone should have a chance to learn and grow.

Now, let’s talk about something completely different: TV! Some people are talking about the best ways to watch TV in the future! It's like finding the perfect snacks to eat while watching your favorite cartoons. Sometimes we need to remember to be thankful for what we have and try to use our screen time wisely.

Finally, imagine you have a fantastic idea, and someone else copies it! Well, that happens in the grown-up world of business all the time! It can be tricky, and it's a good reminder to always be creative, to always be honest, and to keep coming up with new and exciting ideas. Being unique is a gift.

That’s all the news for today, folks! Remember to be kind, be helpful, and always ask questions about the world around you! See you next time!
