(Upbeat, friendly music intro)

**Host:** Hello, Super Friends! It's me, your pal, Newsy Nelly, here to tell you all about what's been happening in the big, wide world today. Buckle up, it's going to be a fun ride!

**(Transition Music - Short and Playful)**

**Host:** First up, some not-so-happy news. Sometimes people make choices that hurt others. Today we heard about a young person, just a bit older than some of you, who made a very bad choice in a place called Toronto. It's a reminder that kindness and thinking before we act is super important. Remember the golden rule? Treat others the way you want to be treated!

**(Transition Music - Short and Playful)**

**Host:** Now, for something AMAZING! Can you imagine flying super high, even higher than the tallest clouds? Well, a paraglider in China accidentally went up, up, up to 8,000 meters! That's like… stacking a zillion school buses on top of each other! They're okay now. It just goes to show you how powerful nature can be, and that even accidents can have wild stories.

**(Transition Music - Short and Playful)**

**Host:** Uh oh, there are people who do bad things again, there is a place called the ‘Golden Triangle’. And those people are trying to traffic meth. That means they're trying to sneakily move something illegal from one place to another. It's like trying to sneak cookies before dinner, but way, way worse. But don't worry, there are people called police who are working hard to stop those people.

**(Transition Music - Short and Playful)**

**Host:** Ever heard of Argentina? It's a country far away, famous for its tango dance! Well, some people in Argentina weren't playing fair with money, and they got caught. It's like when someone takes all the crayons in class, even though everyone needs them. Doing the right thing, even when nobody is watching, is always the best choice!

**(Transition Music - Short and Playful)**

**Host:** Now, let's talk about soldiers! In a country called North Korea, the leader, Kim Jong Un, was checking out the army's big cannons. It's a reminder that grown-ups sometimes disagree and use strong tools. But it's important to always try to talk things out peacefully first. Like sharing your toys instead of fighting over them!

**(Transition Music - Short and Playful)**

**Host:** Speaking of disagreements, truck drivers in Iran are doing something called a strike. That means they stopped working to show they aren't happy with something. It's like when you cross your arms and say, "I don't like this!" Sometimes, we need to find ways to make our voices heard in a respectful way.

**(Transition Music - Short and Playful)**

**Host:** Now, let’s talk about the United States and China. They are having a bit of trouble agreeing on some things. When grown-ups have trouble agreeing, sometimes they need REALLY important people to help them. Like when you and your best friend are fighting, and you need a teacher to help you find a solution.

**(Transition Music - Short and Playful)**

**Host:** Get ready for some AMAZING NEWS! Deep in the jungles of Guatemala, archaeologists (that's like treasure hunters who dig for old things!) found a 3,000-year-old Mayan city! 3,000 years is longer than you can even count! Just imagine all the stories those old stones could tell us! It's like finding a real-life dinosaur bone!

**(Transition Music - Short and Playful)**

**Host:** Remember how we talked about the ocean? Well, in Japan, some people were worried about the water near a power plant. China stopped buying seafood from Japan, but now they will start buying again. It's good when people can work together to solve problems and make sure things are safe for everyone!

**(Transition Music - Short and Playful)**

**Host:** Here's a weather report: it's going to be HOT! Weather forecasters say we can expect some super hot summers. That means lots of sunscreen, hats, and maybe even more ice cream!

**(Transition Music - Short and Playful)**

**Host:** A country called Hamas isn’t agreeing to a ceasefire plan. A ceasefire is when people stop fighting. It's always better when people can stop fighting and try to be friends, so let's hope they work it out.

**(Transition Music - Short and Playful)**

**Host:** There are people working in a place called CBSA, and they seized 67% of bad drugs! That means they took 67% of the bad drugs, to make sure they didn’t hurt people.

**(Transition Music - Short and Playful)**

**Host:** South Korea is launching a drone carrier concept! That means they can carry things in the air with cool robot technology.

**(Transition Music - Short and Playful)**

**Host:** Something is happening at a place called the WEF. Klaus Schwab has filed a criminal complaint against whistleblowers, but you guys are a bit too young to fully understand that.

**(Transition Music - Short and Playful)**

**Host:** Someone named Trump put tariffs on some things. Tariffs are like little taxes that can make prices go up. Because of this, something called Best Buy is hiking some of its prices too!

**(Transition Music - Short and Playful)**

**Host:** Speaking of money, someone is making money by using short-duration Treasurys and European high-yield bonds!

**(Transition Music - Short and Playful)**

**Host:** Apps are very important! In 2024, the App Store in the U.S. made about $406B!

**(Transition Music - Short and Playful)**

**Host:** Someone who is 17 is trying to get into sales! A job is always a great way to get money.

**(Transition Music - Short and Playful)**

**Host:** A big hotel chain wants to buy a laser engraving machine for a business! The small business is considering if they should do it.

**(Transition Music - Short and Playful)**

**Host:** Some bad people are targeting executives. It is important to stay safe, everyone!

**(Transition Music - Short and Playful)**

**Host:** Someone who is 17 is trying to figure out business suggestions!

**(Transition Music - Short and Playful)**

**Host:** And that’s all the news for today! It's been a busy day in our big, wide world, but remember, even though there are tough things happening, there's always good too. And you, my Super Friends, have the power to make the world a brighter place!

**(Transition Music - Upbeat and positive)**

**Host:** So go out there, be kind, be helpful, and remember to always ask questions! Newsy Nelly loves you! Bye!
