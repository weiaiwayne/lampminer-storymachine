**Hello Explorers! It's News Time with Mr. Giggles!**

Hi everybody, and welcome to News Time with yours truly, Mr. Giggles! Get ready to put on your thinking caps, because today we're zooming around the world to see what's been happening!

First stop, Toyland! You know how much we love our toys, right? Well, the person in charge of making toys at Mattel (that's the company that makes Barbie!) said that they might have to make the toys cost a little bit more soon. He wishes that they could bring toys from other countries without having to pay extra tariffs. Tariff is like a toll you have to pay on the way to bring items from other places. I hope toys still don’t get too expensive.

Next up: It sounds like there's been a disagreement between countries called India and Pakistan. It's a bit like when you and your best friend disagree over which game to play. Grown-ups sometimes disagree too! Sadly, sometimes that disagreement can get more serious. Recent reports indicate that India attacked supposed militant groups in Pakistan. A few countries like the USA and China are also involved in the disagreement in terms of who is selling what.

Speaking of friends, it sounds like the USA and the UK (that's England!) are about to become even better friends! They’re going to make a special agreement about buying and selling things to each other. It’s like trading stickers with your friends, but on a much bigger scale. Everyone trading makes it more fun!

Now, let's talk about money! Russia, a big country that sells lots of oil and gas (that's what keeps our cars and houses running!), isn't making as much money from those sales as they used to. This can happen when people buy less of something, or if the price goes down.

And over in Ukraine, some brave people are using drones to protect their country, and there were attacks at two plants where military equipments are made in Russia. It’s very important to pray for peace. Remember that people are more precious than things.

On a much happier note, get this! The FBI, that's like super-detectives, helped rescue over 100 children! They are trying to protect children from people who are trying to hurt them. That’s great news!

We should all remember to be kind and helpful like our moms and teachers tell us to be.

Now, let's talk about Sweden. It sounds like the USA has asked Sweden to stop some of their "diversity initiatives." Diversity is about including lots of different people, which is usually a good thing because everyone is special.

And in a place called Poland, a leader named Mr. Merz wants to stop illegal migration. Migration is when people move from one place to another, and sometimes it's a tricky situation to handle fairly.

This next thing is a bit tricky: some people in Turkey are having trouble using something called "X" (which used to be called "Twitter"). It sounds like a person who wants to be the leader of Turkey couldn't use his account. It's like your game getting paused and you can’t play anymore. It’s important for everyone to be able to share their ideas, but everyone needs to be respectful of each other.

Oh! And North Korea fired some short-range missiles into the sea. Missiles are never fun because they can hurt people. We need to pray for leaders to make smart and kind choices.

Next up, a tricky word: "Tariffs!" Remember when we talked about tariffs in Toyland? Well, this is about all kinds of buying and selling with China. It sounds like the USA and China are trying to decide if they should charge each other extra money (tariffs) for the things they buy and sell. Some people think tariffs can cause prices to go up and slow down the economy (that's like all the money and jobs in a country).

And guess what? Sometimes even grown-ups disagree! It sounds like the Prime Minister of Canada (that's like the President of Canada) and Mr. Trump (who used to be President of the USA) had a meeting, and some people think the Prime Minister made Mr. Trump look a little silly. It's okay to disagree, but it's always important to be kind.

Our next story is about Oil Production. We have talked about Oil prices before. Some oil producers are not happy about the low price of the Oil and have cut down how much oil they produce.

In the business world, it's important to be fair and honest. It sounds like some people are talking about a leader who might make rules that help him make more money for himself. That’s not really the best way to use your talents, is it? It’s better to be honest and fair, so everyone benefits.

That’s all for today, Explorers! Remember to be kind, to think about the world around you, and to always ask questions! The world is big and we need everyone to contribute.
