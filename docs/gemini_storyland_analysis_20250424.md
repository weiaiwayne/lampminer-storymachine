**Sesame Street News – Brought to you by the Letter “E” (for Empathy!)**

**(Opening scene: Elmo, Cookie Monster, and Abby Cadabby are gathered around a cardboard news desk. Oscar the Grouch is nearby in his trash can, grumbling.)**

**Elmo:** Welcome, everyone, to Sesame Street News! Today, we're talking about things happening all over the world!

**Cookie Monster:** (Eyes wide) World? Does world have cookies?

**Abby Cadabby:** Maybe! But today, we’re talking about other important things, Cookie Monster. Like how sometimes people have different ideas about what's fair.

**Elmo:** That’s right, Abby! Like, some people think it’s good to help others even if it takes a little longer, like cleaning a customer’s computer extra shiny.

**Cookie Monster:** Shiny computers! Me like!

**Elmo:** But other people think it's better to be super-fast and charge a little extra to do those extra things. Both ideas are okay, but it can be tricky when people disagree!

**Abby Cadabby:** Exactly! And sometimes that happens in big businesses, too. We heard that some bosses want to be really fast and make lots of money. And that’s…okay!

**Elmo:** But it’s also good to remember to be kind and helpful, even if it costs a little extra time. Like when you’re building houses! Speaking of building, we heard that it's been a little bit harder to build new houses lately.

**Abby Cadabby:** Oh no!

**Elmo:** Yeah, it might be because things cost a little bit more to build right now. When grown-ups take out a loan (to buy something) they promise to pay it back, and it looks like some folks are having a hard time with those payments.

**Cookie Monster:** What’s loan? Does it taste like cookie?

**Elmo:** Not really, Cookie Monster. It's like borrowing something and promising to give it back later. And sometimes, people have trouble paying it back. That can make things tricky for everyone.

**Abby Cadabby:** And we also heard that some people in different countries are disagreeing, too!

**Elmo:** Yeah, they're talking about things like… tariffs! Tariffs are like a little fee you pay when you trade toys with someone in another town. Sometimes, people disagree about how much that fee should be.

**Cookie Monster:** Fee? Me no like fee! Me want cookies!

**Elmo:** Well, sometimes those fees can help us do important things, like build schools or help people who need it.

**Abby Cadabby:** And sometimes, countries have to talk about really big things, like where people can live and how people treat each other! It's important to be kind and fair to everyone, no matter where they come from.

**Elmo:** That's right! And sometimes, even when people disagree, they can talk it out. Like we heard that some people in one place are going to try really hard not to fight and keep talking!

**Oscar the Grouch:** (Pops up from his can) Talking? Ugh! Why can't everyone just be grumpy like me?

**Elmo:** Because being grumpy all the time isn't very fun, Oscar! It's much better to be kind and helpful, even when things are hard! And to talk with other people!

**Abby Cadabby:** Remember friends, even though grown-up news can be complicated, the most important thing is to be kind, helpful, and to always try to understand each other.

**Elmo:** That's right! And now, it's time for… Super Grover to tell us about… SOMETHING ELSE!

**(Super Grover crashes into the set in a cape and helmet.)**

**Super Grover:** Super Grover is here to… wait… what am I here to do?

**(Elmo, Abby, and Cookie Monster giggle as the scene fades out.)**
