## Sesame Street News: Brought to you by the letter "N" for News!

**(Scene opens with Elmo standing at a miniature news desk with the words "Sesame Street News" on it. Cookie Monster and Abby Cadabby are sitting in the audience.)**

**Elmo:** Welcome, everyone, to Sesame Street News! Elmo is your anchor-monster today! Ooh! We have lots of news to share, even if it’s… sometimes a little tricky.

**(Cookie Monster raises his hand enthusiastically.)**

**Cookie Monster:** Can we eat the news?

**Elmo:** (Chuckles) No, Cookie Monster! We can't eat the news. We listen to the news, and then we think about it.

**Abby Cadabby:** Ooh, what's the first news story, Elmo?

**Elmo:** Okay! First, Elmo heard that someone was looking for their brother, and they finally found him! That's wonderful. Elmo thinks families are very important!

**(A short animated clip shows a family reuniting with lots of hugs.)**

**Elmo:** Next! Elmo heard that someone called Mr. Trump is talking about two countries called Canada and the US. He thinks they're good neighbors. Sometimes, neighbors disagree on things, but it's important to be kind to each other! Elmo loves his neighbors on Sesame Street.

**(Bert and Ernie wave from their window in the background.)**

**Elmo:** Now, Cookie Monster, this one's a little complicated. Sometimes, countries put extra costs on things they buy from other countries. It’s like when you buy cookies at Hooper's store. If you want to buy cookies from another store far away, it might cost more because of those extra costs. Mr. Trump is talking about these costs for cars from Canada.

**Cookie Monster:** (Eyes widening) More costs mean fewer cookies!

**Elmo:** It can mean things cost more! Which is why it’s important for leaders to be fair and think about everyone.

**Abby Cadabby:** What else, Elmo?

**Elmo:** Elmo heard there was fighting in a far-away place called DR Congo. But the good news is they said they'll stop fighting and talk instead! Talking and listening is always a good idea! Like when Oscar is grumpy, we try to talk and cheer him up.

**(Oscar pops out of his trash can, scowls, and slams the lid shut.)**

**Elmo:** Okay, now for something a little tricky, in the United States, people need homes to live in! Elmo is happy to live on Sesame Street! Elmo heard that not as many new homes were built this year. That makes it harder for everyone to find a place to live. Building takes hard work, and Elmo believes everyone should have a safe place to live and to create a family.

**Abby Cadabby:** Oh, that’s sad.

**Elmo:** It is a little sad, Abby. But it also means builders need to work even harder to build more homes!

**Cookie Monster:** Speaking of work, me work hard to eat cookies!

**Elmo:** Elmo also heard that some people, called Gen Z, are saying that some older people don't understand how hard they work! Sometimes, grown-ups and younger people see things differently. It's important to listen to each other and be kind.

**(A short animated clip shows a child and an adult working together, helping each other.)**

**Elmo:** And last, people are also talking about money, Elmo heard that some people are selling some stocks in the U.S. Stock is like owning a tiny little piece of a company! Elmo doesn't know what to think about that!

**Abby Cadabby:** Whew! That was a lot of news, Elmo!

**Elmo:** It was! Sometimes, the news can be confusing. But remember, even when things seem tricky, it’s important to be kind, listen to each other, and work together to make the world a better place!

**Cookie Monster:** And eat cookies!

**Elmo:** (Laughing) And maybe eat a cookie, Cookie Monster! That's all for Sesame Street News today! See you next time!

**(Elmo waves goodbye as the theme music plays.)**
