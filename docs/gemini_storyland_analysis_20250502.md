Hello everybody, and welcome to "News for Nifty Nuggets"! I'm your host, Penelope Pineapple, and I'm ready to tell you about what's been happening in the world while you were busy being awesome!

First up, some grown-ups haven’t been playing fair at baseball games. A parent got upset because some people said mean things, called taunts, to someone because of where their family came from. Now, baseball is supposed to be fun for everyone! It reminds us that treating others with kindness and respect is *always* the right thing to do, no matter what. It’s like the Golden Rule: treat others how you want to be treated!

Next, some old rules about schools are changing in America. A long, long time ago, some schools weren’t fair to all kids. But now, some of those rules are being taken away, so hopefully, everyone can have a chance to learn and grow together. It is important for us to remember that everyone deserves a good opportunity in life. 

Oh no! A soldier in a faraway place called Okinawa did something very, very wrong and hurt someone. That's not good at all! We should all be helpers and peacemakers, not bullies.

Now, let's talk about yummy things! Did you know that countries buy and sell things to each other? It's like trading toys! Right now, China and the United States are trying to figure out a good way to trade. They're talking about things called "tariffs," which are like extra fees on things they sell. One country thinks the other is not playing fair! But they're trying to find a solution.

Great news! In a country called Uganda, a sickness called Ebola is gone! Doctors and nurses worked really hard to make people better, and now everyone is safe! That shows what happens when smart and caring people work together!

Now, this is a serious topic. Some grown-ups in India and Pakistan are arguing. A long time ago, there was a terrorist attack on a group of people, and now, some people are talking about fighting. Fighting is never a good idea. It's always better to talk things out and find a peaceful solution. Remember, we all belong to God’s Big Family.

Speaking of arguments, some people in the Philippines aren't very happy with their government. They think their democracy – that's when everyone gets a say – has "problems." It's important for grown-ups to listen to each other and work together to make things better.

In the country of Ukraine, some brave people are defending their homes from other people who are taking over. It is taking a very, very long time for the other group to gain any more land. It reminds us that freedom is valuable, and it's important to stand up for what's right, even when it's hard.

China and the United States are having some "discussions" about spies! One country thinks the other is trying to steal secrets. Countries have to learn to be trusting of each other.

Guess what? There’s a sickness called measles that’s spreading quickly in a place called Ontario. Make sure you listen to your parents and doctors and get all your shots to stay healthy!

Did you know that some very important people are going to a cold, icy land called Greenland? They want to learn more about what's under the ice! It's always exciting to explore new places and discover new things.

Sometimes, even when grown-ups have lots and lots of money, they can still be sad, especially when they're getting very old and sick. It reminds us that money isn't the most important thing in life. Kindness, love, and helping others are much more valuable.

Some very talented people are having their shows canceled because grown ups don't agree with what they said in their videos. We should give grace to others with different views.

Lastly, a person is building a new machine. It allows you to send text messages from a computer using your own phone. What do you think? It may be very useful!

And that's all the news for today, Nifty Nuggets! Remember to be kind, be curious, and be awesome! Penelope Pineapple, signing off!
