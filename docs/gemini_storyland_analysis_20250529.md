**News for Super Smart First Graders!**

Hello, super scholars! It's your pal, Penelope the Parrot, here to give you the latest news, squawk! Are you ready to become news experts? Let's dive in!

**(Weather Woes and Wonderful Ways to Help!)**

First up, some grown-up weather forecasters are saying that it might get extra, extra, extra hot for the next few summers! Whew, that's a lot of heat, like when you leave your crayons in the sun! So, what can we do? Well, think of it like helping your flowers grow. We need to be kind to our planet! Remember to drink lots of water and find some shade, just like we learn in Bible school how the Lord's favor is like a cloud of blessing! Also, don't forget to turn off the lights when you leave a room and plant a tree! This helps the planet cool down. How awesome would it be to plant a tree that gives shade and is a legacy for the future!

**(A Sad Story and Being Kind to Everyone!)**

Now, there's a sad story about someone who needed help and didn't get it in time. Sometimes people, even grown-ups, have a tough time finding a safe place to live. We need to remember to be kind and help everyone we can, no matter who they are. Just like Jesus taught us! Remember to be grateful for the roof over our heads and share our toys with those who don't have as many. The world can be much better when we all lend a hand, even if it's just a smile!

**(Musk's Moves and Doggone Good News!)**

Guess what? A really smart guy named Elon Musk is leaving the White House (that's where the President works!). But he says his favorite dog, Doge (yes, a dog!), will still be around. It's like when your favorite teacher moves to a new school, but you still get to see their friendly dog! Sometimes people change jobs, but the important thing is to keep being kind and doing good work, wherever you go!

**(Food Problems and Sharing is Caring!)**

In a faraway place called Gaza, there is a great shortage of food. And some hungry people were trying to get food from a warehouse, but sadly some people got hurt. When we have enough, it is important to share with others. Think of it like your lunchbox. If a friend forgets theirs, you should share a sandwich! We can also pray for people in other places to have enough food.

**(Tech Triumph and Trading Troubles!)**

Some super-smart companies that make computers and gadgets are doing really well! It's like when you build a super tall tower with your blocks! But sometimes, countries don't agree on how to trade toys (or other things) with each other. It's like when you want to trade your race car for a dinosaur, but your friend wants your other race car. One man, Mr. Trump, wanted to charge extra for things coming from other countries (tariffs). But, the court said he can’t do that using one way. But he can still do that using another way, but only if he has a good reason. The important thing is to be fair and honest, even when trading! Because in the end, what we do affects others!

**(Money Matters and Being Wise!)**

Some very, very rich people are moving their gold to a place called Singapore. It's like hiding your favorite stuffed animal in a safe place! They're worried about things happening in the world, so they want to keep their treasures safe. It is important to be smart with money, but also to be generous and help others, because our true riches are the treasures we store in heaven!

**(Hacking Help and Keeping Secrets!)**

Britain, a country far away, is building an "army of hackers". That sounds like an amazing video game! They want to protect themselves from bad guys online. It's like when you build a strong fort to keep your toys safe. It’s also like being a watchman to protect the things we love, as the Bible says. It is important to keep your passwords safe, and only trust grown-ups with them!

**(A Smart Idea and Time for Fun!)**

Some grown-ups think that we should work fewer days each week, so that way, they have more time for fun. But work hard and play hard! This is why the Bible tells us to work for six days, and rest on the seventh!

**(Tariff Tiffs and Trading Fairly!)**

Remember those tariffs? Well, the courts are still deciding if they’re okay. It’s like when Mom and Dad disagree about bedtime. The important thing is for everyone to be fair and follow the rules, even if it’s hard. But if countries charge more or less for trading with each other, it is always important to be nice and fair!

**(Building Dreams and Breaking Barriers!)**

There is a very smart woman building her own construction company, a place where builders build houses! But sometimes it's harder to get people to trust you when you are a woman in a man’s job, especially when people are being unfair! But it is important to keep doing what you know is right!

**(Virus Vacations and Staying Safe!)**

Some companies stopped making some medicine that can help fight viruses, which isn't good. This is not like your regular medicine for the flu, but a special medicine that helps people stay safe during the pandemic!

That's all the news for today, super scholars! Remember to be kind, work hard, share your toys, and always ask questions! Penelope out! Squawk!
