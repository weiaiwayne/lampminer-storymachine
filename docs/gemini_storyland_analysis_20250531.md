(Upbeat, playful music intro)

Hello, super-smart first graders! It's your pal, Penelope the Penguin, here with today's BIG news! Are you ready to put on your thinking caps? Let's dive in!

First up, remember how we talked about being helpers and friends to everyone? Well, some peacekeepers in a faraway place called Lebanon, who were trying to help keep things calm, were hurt. It's like when you're trying to build a tower of blocks, and someone knocks it down – it's not very nice, and sometimes people get a boo-boo. We hope they feel better soon and that everyone learns to share and be kind.

Now, imagine you’re flying on a big airplane called IndiGo! It's like a really long school bus in the sky! Well, the people in charge of IndiGo are being asked to use different airplanes from a country called Turkey. It's a bit like choosing which crayons to use for your coloring – sometimes grown-ups have different reasons for choosing. Grown-ups have to make decisions about who they work with, and sometimes it can be a bit complicated, like untangling your jump rope!

Speaking of grown-ups and making choices, the person in charge of Russia, Mr. Putin, won’t be going to peace talks. And someone named Mr. Trump wants the war to end right away. It's like when you and your friend are arguing over a toy, and both of you really want it to stop. Grown-ups sometimes have trouble agreeing, just like us! Remember, even when it's hard, trying to find a way to get along is always the best thing to do.

Next, the leader of Argentina, Mr. Milei, is going on a trip to meet Pope Leo XIV, who’s like the head teacher of a really big church, and he’s also visiting a place called Israel! That’s like going on a super-duper field trip to learn about new things and meet new people! I bet he will learn a lot about kindness and sharing.

And get this! Mr. Macron, who is in charge of France, wants a super-special friendship between Europe and some countries near India and the Pacific Ocean. Friendships are like amazing gardens, where you need to take care of each other and water the plants so they can grow beautifully!

Oh no! In Cuba, a place with sandy beaches and yummy fruits, someone from the United States got a talking-to because they weren't being very respectful. It's like when you forget to say "please" and "thank you" – it's important to be polite!

Uh oh! There are lots of wildfires burning in Canada! That's like a campfire that got too big. Firefighters, who are like super-brave heroes, are working hard to put them out. We should remember to be thankful for our firefighters.

Believe it or not! Some people in Italy are teaming up together, and even some from the mafia. Sometimes people group up for the wrong reasons. Working together is good, but it's always important to make sure you're doing what's right!

The United Nations, which is like a big club for all the countries in the world, needs to save money, so they might have fewer people working there. It's like when you have to decide which toys you really need to keep and which ones you can share with someone else. It’s a reminder that we must be wise about the resources that have been entrusted to us.

Speaking of playing fairly, someone in Canada was caught trying to send military supplies to Russia illegally. It's like trying to sneak extra cookies from the cookie jar – it's not fair to everyone else!

And! People in Iran who drive trucks are protesting, and lots of other people are cheering them on. It's like when you stand up for your friends when something isn't right!

Listen to this! Some sources in the Middle East said that Saudi Arabia told Iran that they should make an agreement with the United States, or they might have a war with Israel. Oh no! It's like when Mom or Dad needs to make sure you play nicely and settle your differences.

Some good news! A company called GM is spending lots of money to make things in New York! That means more jobs for grown-ups and more shiny new things!

Uh oh! A new tax bill in America is making some people who work with money a little nervous. It's like when you're saving your allowance and suddenly have to spend some of it on something unexpected!

Are all the new coins on the internet scams? That's like asking if all candy is good for you – some are definitely better than others! It's important to be smart about what you buy and ask a grown-up for help.

Also, Mr. Trump said he might charge extra money for steel from other countries. It’s like when you put a higher price on your lemonade at the lemonade stand to make more money. But some people feel it is unfair to charge more.

Listen to this! Someone named Hillary Clinton made some predictions about Mr. Trump a long time ago, and they are becoming true. It is important to remember to think carefully about the words we speak.

And finally, some people are wondering if it’s useful to have a board of directors if some of them might be corrupt, greedy, or evil. It’s like asking if it's worth having rules if some people don't follow them. It’s always important to be kind and honest.

(Penelope sighs dramatically)

Whew! That was a lot of news for one day! Remember, even though the world can seem big and complicated, being kind, honest, and helpful makes a HUGE difference. Now go out there and be amazing!
