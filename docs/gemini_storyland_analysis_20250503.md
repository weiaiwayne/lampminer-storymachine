Hello Everybody! It's your pal, Penelope the Possum, here, bringing you the news!

Wowzers, what a busy day it's been! Let’s dive into all the exciting things happening around our big, beautiful world.

First up, get this: Did you know that the world's TALLEST dog and the world's SMALLEST dog had a playdate? Can you imagine? It's like a giraffe trying to play tag with an ant! I hope they shared their toys nicely. Remember, friends, sharing is caring, whether you're big or small. Just like we read in Sunday school, we should be kind to everyone, no matter how different they are!

Now, over in Spain, things got a little dark. They had a big power outage! It's like when the lights flicker during a thunderstorm, but imagine it happening to a whole country! Maybe they need to check their extension cords! Sometimes, things happen that we don't expect, and that's okay. It teaches us to be prepared and help each other out when the lights go out, literally or figuratively.

Across the ocean in Australia, they had an election. That's when grown-ups get to choose who will make important decisions for their country. And they were thinking about two big things: prices being too high, and not enough houses for everyone. It reminds us that sometimes, there are problems that need solving. And even though it might seem hard, we can all do our part to be helpful and kind. Maybe we can find ways to share our toys or help our neighbors!

Oh dear, I almost forgot to tell you what happened in Chile! BOOM! A HUGE earthquake rattled the country. Thankfully, everyone’s ok! That shows us how powerful nature can be. It’s a good reminder to be grateful for our safe homes and remember to pray for those who might not be as lucky.

Now, speaking of grown-up stuff, there's some talk about money and prices. McDonald’s and Forever 21 are having some trouble. Forever 21 is closing all their stores in the US which means less yummy burgers and less fun clothing! It's like when your favorite toy store closes, it's a bit sad, isn't it? Sometimes, businesses have a hard time, and people might lose their jobs. That's why it's important to be smart with our money and help those who need it. Being generous is a really cool quality.

Some places in the world aren't getting along. We have Ukraine and Russia which are still in conflict. Also, it was reported that Israel launched airstrikes in Syria. Conflict can be hard for everyone to understand, right? It’s important to remember that everyone deserves to feel safe and loved. Conflict sometimes happens in the world because people have differing beliefs and goals but one thing is true: we should try to be peacekeepers and avoid unnecessary conflict!

There’s a report that England is having an election and people are voting differently than before! It reminds us that things can change over time, and that's okay. The world is always changing and that’s the beauty of living!

There’s some talk about Costa Rica and El Salvador, they are building new prisons. Sometimes, people do bad things, and it's important to have rules to keep everyone safe. It’s important to remember that even when people make mistakes, we should offer forgiveness and try to help them learn and grow.

And finally, Prince Harry said the King ‘won’t speak to him’ and that he would ‘love’ to be reconciled. It's important to remember that even families have disagreements sometimes. What is important is that we should always try to talk to each other and forgive each other, because families are very special.

*(Penelope puffs out her cheeks and takes a deep breath)*

Phew! That was a lot of news! But you know what? Even when things seem complicated or a little scary, there's always room for kindness, generosity, and understanding. Just like the world's tallest and smallest dogs, we can all learn to get along and play together nicely. Always remember to do your best, be kind to others, and maybe even share your cookies. This has been your pal, Penelope the Possum, bringing you the news, and remember, God loves you, and so do I! Now, if you’ll excuse me, I think I see a cookie with my name on it! Bye-bye!
