(Upbeat, friendly music intro)

**Host:** Hello, explorers! Welcome to "News for Little Sprouts," where we dig up the big stories of the day and plant them in your brain gardens in a way that’s easy to understand. Are you ready to grow your knowledge? Let's jump in!

(Sound of a playful "boing")

**Host:** First up, we're hopping across the ocean to the United States! Sometimes, leaders of different countries disagree, kind of like when you and your best friend argue over which game to play. Well, the leader of America, called the President, said something about the leader of Russia. The leader of Russia didn't get upset, but said he just thought the American President was getting a little too emotional. It's always important to try and talk things out calmly, isn't it? Maybe they could share a cookie and make up! We should always pray for peace between countries and for leaders to be wise. After all, working together is always better than fighting!

(Sound of gentle splashing)

**Host:** Now, let's paddle over to a sunny place called Suriname! They just had an election, which is like a big class vote to decide who gets to lead. The two teams were super close! It’s like a tie in tag. It just goes to show that every vote counts, even in our classroom when we choose what story to read! It is amazing how in some countries, people can have the freedom to vote!

(Sound of a whooshing jet plane)

**Host:** Next, we’re jetting off to Latvia! Latvia is a country in Europe that’s asking other countries to maybe not let people from Russia visit right now. It’s like when one friend isn't being very nice, so you might need some space for a little while. Latvia thinks it's important to stand up for what's right. Now, you might ask yourself what “right” is. Think about how you’d want to be treated and treat everyone else the same way!

(Sound of a lightbulb turning on)

**Host:** Let's zoom in to something called "Starlink." Imagine having a super-fast internet connection that could reach even the most remote places on Earth! One person in a country called Malatsi is being asked if he did the right thing in choosing that. It’s a big decision because everyone deserves to have access to information.

(Sound of cheering crowd)

**Host:** Oh my goodness! Let's head to Liverpool, a city in England, where people were celebrating their soccer team's victory! But oh dear! A car accidentally drove into the crowd and hurt a lot of people. It’s a reminder that even during happy times, we need to be careful and look out for each other. It’s also a good reminder to pray for those who were hurt and to be thankful for our safety every day.

(Sound of beakers bubbling)

**Host:** We’re traveling to Japan, where scientists are doing something super cool! They're working on making artificial blood! Can you imagine? This could help so many people who need blood transfusions in hospitals. It’s amazing how smart people can use their brains to help others. It shows we all have talents, and maybe one day, you can use yours to help people, too!

(Sound of coins clinking)

**Host:** Now, let’s talk about money, but not in a boring way! Sometimes, countries sell "bonds," which are like IOUs. It's getting a little tricky to figure out the value of these bonds! The economy is like a big game of seesaw, and sometimes it goes up and sometimes it goes down. It reminds us that we should always be careful with our resources and not take things for granted!

(Sound of a robot whirring)

**Host:** Uh oh! Some college graduates are having trouble finding jobs. One reason is that robots and computers are getting really good at doing things, thanks to something called Artificial Intelligence, or AI. This is a big question for grown-ups to figure out: How can we make sure everyone has a chance to use their talents in a world where robots can do a lot of things? It makes you think about what makes us special as humans, doesn't it? What can *you* do that a robot can't? Maybe you're an amazing artist, a super friend, or a really good storyteller!

(Sound of a cash register "cha-ching")

**Host:** There's been some talk about whether immigrants are taking jobs away from people. But many people disagree! They believe that immigrants can actually help the economy by working hard and bringing new ideas. It's important to remember that everyone deserves a fair chance, no matter where they come from. And you know what's also right? Being grateful for what we have.

(Sound of coins clinking)

**Host:** Did you know that there's another kind of money besides the dollar called the Euro? Well, some people think the Euro could become just as important as the dollar! Different countries use different kinds of money, isn't that interesting? It's like everyone has a different favorite color!

(Sound of sneaky tiptoeing)

**Host:** Businesses have found a sneaky way to get around paying extra money, called "tariffs," when they bring things into the country. It's like finding a secret shortcut on a game board! It's perfectly legal, but it makes you wonder if it's always fair. Hmmm...

(Sound of waves lapping)

**Host:** And finally, let’s send some encouragement to an entrepreneur from a sunny island! She makes swimsuits and wants to sell them to more people. Maybe you can help her! What makes a great swimsuit? What colors do you like? What is unique about that island? There are so many amazing business opportunities if we try hard enough!

(Upbeat, friendly music outro)

**Host:** Wow, that was a lot of news! Remember, little sprouts, keep asking questions, keep thinking big, and keep being kind! See you next time on "News for Little Sprouts!"
