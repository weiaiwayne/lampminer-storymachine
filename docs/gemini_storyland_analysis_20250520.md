Hello, Nifty Nuggets! It's your pal, Penelope Pip, here to tell you about all sorts of exciting things going on! Are you ready? Let’s dive in!

First up, some super exciting news! Remember Elmo, Cookie Monster, and all their fuzzy friends from Sesame Street? Well, guess what? They're making a new home on Netflix! It's like moving into a brand-new, giant playhouse filled with all their favorite games and songs! Sharing is caring, and now even more friends can watch Sesame Street! What a wonderful way to learn the alphabet and how to be good friends with everyone.

Now, let's hop over to New Orleans. Imagine playing hide-and-seek, but…not really playing. Some people escaped from jail, and that's NOT good! It’s like sneaking out of school but for a much more serious reason. Thankfully, the police caught one of them, but some are still at large. It reminds us how important it is to follow the rules and that everyone needs to be responsible for their actions. The police officers are working hard to keep everyone safe, just like superheroes!

Next stop: San Francisco! Picture driving around town without a grown-up behind the wheel! That's what's happening there! Alphabet, a big company, is testing robot taxis. It is important to consider how using new inventions might change the world, and who it affects.

Zooming across the ocean, we find China making some big changes to their money rules. Imagine if the price of your favorite candy changed! That's kind of what's happening there. Sometimes countries have to make these changes to help businesses grow. Just like how your family might save money to buy something special.

Australia is having some grown-up disagreements. The grown-ups in charge of the country aren’t all agreeing anymore. It's like when you and your best friend can’t agree on what game to play. It's important to listen to each other, even when we disagree.

Ooh la la! We're flying to France! The leader of France, Mr. Macron, is very excited because lots of smart people want to invest in France! They are spending lots of money on something called AI which means Artificial Intelligence, and you'll learn about it as you grow up. It's like when you’re building a Lego castle and lots of people want to help you make it super awesome.

Oh no! A tiny town in Canada is shrinking! Residents are moving out. It's kind of sad, like when your favorite tree in the park gets cut down. Communities are important, and we should appreciate the places we live.

Moving onto India, its army used its own Akashteer system during an Operation. It helped protect the country, which goes to show how good it is to have things that protect you.

Moving on. Sometimes even countries disagree! Equatorial Guinea and Gabon, are arguing over some islands that have oil. It's like arguing over who gets the last cookie. It shows us how important it is to share and be fair.

In El Salvador, a human rights lawyer was arrested for helping deported migrants! It's important to stand up for people when they are being treated badly. Even if you are small you can still help.

The grown-ups are talking about a war in a place called Gaza. The United States wants the war to end, but it's complicated. It is a serious matter. We must always wish and pray for the well being of everyone, especially children.

Poland is having an election, and some people are trying to trick others online. It’s important to be careful about what you see on the internet, just like how your parents tell you not to believe everything you read!

Across the sea in Britain, many people feel like strangers in their own country. It's a reminder to be kind and welcoming to everyone, no matter where they come from. Just like inviting a new kid to play at recess!

Back in the US, a petition is asking the President to remember Guam. It is important to respect where people live.

And last but not least: Someone wrote a book about the wealth of nations by a smart man called Adam Smith. He showed how people working together could make the world richer, and have more things.
